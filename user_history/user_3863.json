The phrase \"in recent years\" is an adverbial phrase specifying when this development took place.]",

Comparison: The student's answer focuses solely on one significant development (artificial intelligence), which is relevant to the question, but lacks depth or elaboration. The ideal answer does not provide any response as it serves as a placeholder for user-generated responses.\n\n2. Suggestions to Improve:\n   - To make your answer more informative and engaging, consider providing examples or explanations about how artificial intelligence has impacted various fields or aspects of life. This will enhance the relevance, structure, and fluency of your response.\n   - Enhancing your vocabulary and grammar by using a variety of sentence structures and precise terminology will not only improve the quality of your answer but also demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic. For example: \"One of the most significant developments in recent years is artificial intelligence, which has revolutionized numerous sectors such as healthcare, finance, and transportation through advanced machine learning algorithms and autonomous systems.\"",

      "grammar_feedback": " Corrected Sentence:\n\"The most significant developments in recent years have been artificial intelligence and air defense systems.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis corrected sentence is grammatically correct and uses natural phrasing. It clearly states that two specific developments, namely artificial intelligence (AI) and air defense systems, are the most significant in the recent past. The use of the plural form 'developments' indicates more than one development. Also, we used 'have been' to express the ongoing nature of these developments since they happened in recent years. This is called present perfect continuous tense which shows an action started and continues up until now.",
      "pronunciation_feedback": "1. Unclear pronunciation can be caused by a variety of factors, such as speaking too quickly, improper articulation, accent differences, or insufficient practice. In this case, the words \"development,\" \"air,\" and \"defense\" seem to have been pronounced with less clarity than usual.\n\n  2. Word: development \u2014 Tip: Practice enunciating each syllable slowly and clearly. Repeat the word several times in a row, focusing on maintaining consistent volume and pitch for each syllable. Additionally, try reading sentences or passages that contain this word to improve its usage in context.\n\n   - Word: air \u2014 Tip: Work on producing the 'r' sound at the end of the word by placing your tongue tip slightly behind the upper teeth and letting it vibrate as you produce the final consonant sound. Also, practice saying \"air\" followed by words starting with a vowel to ensure proper articulation.\n   - Word: defense \u2014 Tip: Enunciate each syllable distinctly, focusing on placing equal emphasis on all three. Practice speaking at a slower pace to ensure clarity. Additionally, try reading sentences or passages that contain this word to improve its usage in context.\n\n3. General Tip 1: Increase your overall speaking speed gradually by starting with shorter phrases and sentences, then working up to longer ones as you feel more comfortable. Remember to continue focusing on clarity and enunciation while increasing your pace.\n\n   - General Tip 2: Engage in regular conversation practice with native speakers or conversational language exchange partners. This will help you become more familiar with proper pronunciation, intonation, and idiomatic expressions. Regular practice is key to improving both fluency and pronunciation.",
      "comparison_feedback": "1. Comparison:\nThe user's spoken answer provides a list of two significant developments, which is relevant to the question. However, the response lacks depth and explanation as to why these topics are considered significant or how they have impacted society, technology, or other areas. The ideal answer does not provide any information; thus, the user's answer is less comprehensive but still relevant.\n\n2. Suggestions for improvement:\n   a) To make the response more informative and engaging, consider providing examples or anecdotes that illustrate the impact of these developments (e.g., how AI is used in daily life or recent advancements in air defense systems).\n   b) Include a clear introduction to set the context and provide a conclusion that summarizes the main points made in the response, making the answer more structured and coherent.",
